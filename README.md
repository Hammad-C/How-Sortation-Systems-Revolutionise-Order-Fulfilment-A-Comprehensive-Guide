By using barcode scanning technology at various points along the conveyor line coupled with sophisticated software algorithms; they can identify each item's exact location and track its progress throughout the facility accurately. This ensures that each item reaches its intended destination without any mix-ups or errors.
With increasing consumer expectations for fast delivery times and free shipping options thanks to e-commerce giants like Amazon setting new standards, businesses must be able to keep up. Sortation systems have enabled this by reducing order processing and shipping times dramatically. This has helped companies gain a competitive edge in the market while also improving customer satisfaction.
## Types of Sortation Systems: Conveyor vs. Automated vs. Manual
Sortation systems are an essential component of modern order fulfilment, helping businesses streamline their processes and increase efficiency. There are various types of sortation systems available in the market, each with its unique features and benefits. In this section, we will discuss the three main types of sortation systems – conveyor, automated, and manual – and compare their functionalities to help you make an informed decision for your business.

**1.** Conveyor Sortation Systems:
Conveyor sortation systems use a series of belts or rollers to transport items from one location to another within a warehouse or distribution centre. These systems can be either powered or gravity-fed, depending on the weight and size of the items being sorted. Powered conveyor systems use motors to move items along the belt at a controlled speed while gravity-fed systems rely on gravity to move items down angled chutes.
One major advantage of conveyor sortation systems is their high throughput capacity, making them ideal for handling large volumes of goods. They also offer flexibility in terms of sorting criteria as they can be programmed to sort based on weight, size, shape, destination, etc.
However, conveyor sortation systems require significant upfront investment costs and may not be suitable for small-scale operations due to space limitations. They also require regular maintenance and may experience downtime if any components malfunction.

**2.** Automated Sortation Systems:
Automated sortation systems use advanced technologies such as sensors, scanners, and software programs to automatically identify and divert items onto specific lanes or chutes based on predetermined criteria. These sophisticated technologies allow for accurate sorting at high speeds with minimal human intervention.
One major benefit of automated sortation systems is their ability to handle complex sorting tasks efficiently. They are also highly customizable according to specific business needs and can easily integrate with other warehouse management software for seamless operations.
However, like conveyor sortation systems, automated sorters require significant investment costs and maintenance expenses. They also have a learning curve for employees who need to operate and maintain them.

**3.** Manual Sortation Systems:
Manual sortation systems involve human labour in the sorting process, where workers physically pick and place items into designated bins, bags, or containers. This type of sorting is best suited for smaller operations with low volume requirements.
The main advantage of manual sortation systems is their relatively lower upfront costs compared to conveyor and automated systems. They also offer flexibility in terms of handling various types of goods that may not be suitable for automated or conveyor systems.
However, manual sortation can be time-consuming and prone to errors due to human factors. It also requires a larger workforce, increasing labour costs in the long run.
## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Sortation System;
When it comes to streamlining order fulfilment processes and increasing efficiency, choosing the right sortation system is crucial. A well-designed sortation system can help reduce errors, increase accuracy, and speed up the overall order processing time. However, with a variety of options available in the market, it can be overwhelming to choose the most suitable one for your specific needs. In this section, we will discuss some key factors that you should consider when selecting a sortation system for your business.

1. Order Volume:
The first factor to consider is your current and future order volume. The sortation system you select should have sufficient capacity to handle your daily order volume as well as any potential growth in the future. It is essential to analyse your business's projected growth and choose a system that can accommodate those changes without causing bottlenecks or delays.

2. Types of Products:
Different products require different handling methods during sorting. For instance, fragile items may need gentle handling while large or heavy items may require more robust equipment.
